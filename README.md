## Overview
The **Advanced Traffic Control System** is an AI-powered solution designed to optimize urban traffic flow. Developed by **Team iBreakStuff**, the project was a finalist at **YANTRA HACK'25** organized by [SW VIT](https://yantrahack.swvit.in/) and [IEEE CS](https://www.ieeecsvit.com/).

The system integrates AI-based traffic analysis, an API for real-time data communication, and a hardware-driven response mechanism to improve urban road network efficiency.

Special thanks to **Krithika Ma'am** for mentorship and **SW VIT, IEEE CS, judges, and committee members** for organizing the hackathon.

## Project Flow
1. The **AI model** processes live traffic data.
2. The **API** receives and structures this data.
3. **Electronics and the website** access the data and adjust traffic control mechanisms accordingly.
